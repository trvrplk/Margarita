=Make a site with XML
_Margarita_ generates CSS for XML to become a site. 

==Files required _Before_ Margsrita-fying
You will need a *index.htm* file, and *an RSS feed*. I recommend my other product RSSify[http://cookiebatch.github.com/RSSify/] for making new posts.

==Making the CSS 
_Margarita_ will output CSS. Add this to a style.css file. Now, type 

	<?xml-stylesheet type="text/css" href="style.css"?>

in your *rss.xml* or *atom.xml* file.

=Thats it! You're done!
